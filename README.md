Fun with data

# Playing around with data handling and display/
**Uses jQuery** (mostly to use AJAX and csv-to-object plugin).

Loads data from csv file (example file uses basic country facts).

Puts data into object.

Countries can be ordered by name, population or area. Buttons toggle sort direction.



That's as far I've got.
